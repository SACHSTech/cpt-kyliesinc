## SHOWVID-19 JAVAFX PROJECT

I chose COVID-19 as my topic because it is a current and pressing issue that has affected the entire world. The pandemic has had a significant impact on people's health, economies, and daily lives. It has also highlighted existing inequalities and disparities in our societies. I collected my data from [OWID](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2020-03-01..latest&facet=none&pickerSort=asc&pickerMetric=location&Metric=Confirmed+cases&Interval=7-day+rolling+average&Relative+to+Population=true&Color+by+test+positivity=false&country=USA~GBR~CAN~DEU~ITA~IND). The data that I have included as my csv file contains all countries and their daily covid cases. Each column contains iso-code, continent, country, data, total cases, new cases, total cases per million, and new cases per million. In my data, I mostly just use the continents, country, and total cases to create my display.
